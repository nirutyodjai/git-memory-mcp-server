# Email to Trae IDE Team

**Subject:** Thank You Trae IDE Team for Supporting New Developers

---

Dear Trae IDE Team,

Hello!

I am a relatively new user of Trae IDE who started using it not too long ago. I must admit that initially, I couldn't code at all. However, with the help of AI in Trae IDE, I've been able to accomplish so much more - from basic coding to achievements I never thought I could reach.

Today I have some great news to share:

🎉 **My Git Memory MCP Server project has been officially published on NPM!**

📈 **It now supports upgraded connectivity capabilities for up to 300 MCP servers simultaneously**

📚 **Successfully uploaded the project to GitHub with comprehensive documentation**

In the project's README.md documentation, I've included an "Acknowledgments" section to thank the Trae IDE Team for developing this excellent tool that enables people like me, who couldn't code before, to actually create meaningful projects. I hope the team doesn't mind that I included the team's name in the project.

Lastly, I haven't used SOLO yet. I'm curious to know how far someone like me, who couldn't code initially, could go with SOLO. If it's not too much trouble, I would love for the team to consider adding me to it.

Thank you so much for creating tools that help me and others who are starting to code achieve our dreams.

With sincere gratitude
