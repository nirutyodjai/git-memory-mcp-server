## 🌟 Overview

Welcome to the official Bright Data's Web MCP server, solving web access for LLMs and AI agents by allowing them to effectively search, extract and navigate the web without getting blocked. The Web MCP supports all major LLMs, IDEs and agent frameworks (either locally hosted, SSE or Streamable HTTP), enabling your tools to seamlessly search the web, navigate websites, take action and retrieve data - without getting blocked.

🚀 The Web MCP includes **5,000 free requests each month** - ideal for your everyday use and for prototyping smart agentic workflows.

> **Note**: The Web MCP free tier offers 5,000 requests per month for the first 3 months. After that, a credit card will be required, but there will be no extra charges unless premium features like **mcp_browser** or **Web Scrapers** are used.

2. Go to Claude > Settings > Developer > Edit Config > Edit "claude_desktop_config.json" to include the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bright Data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "<insert-your-api-token-here>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### 🛸 Or for more advanced options: 

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "Bright Data": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@brightdata/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "API_TOKEN": "<insert-your-api-token-here>",
        "RATE_LIMIT": "<optional if you want to change rate limit format: limit/time+unit, e.g., 100/1h, 50/30m, 10/5s>",
        "WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE": "<optional if you want to override the web unlocker zone name - default is mcp_unlocker>",
        "BROWSER_ZONE": "<optional if you want to override the browser zone name - defaults is mcp_browser>",
        "PRO_MODE": "<optional boolean, defaults to false. Set to true to expose all tools including browser and web_data_* tools>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Available Tools

> **Important:** Pro mode **is not included in the free tier** and will incur additional charges. If you choose to use **Pro mode**, you’ll gain access to all 60 tools but please be aware of the associated costs.

To enable **Pro mode**, simply add `"PRO_MODE"=true` to your enviroment variables.

[List of Available Tools](https://github.com/brightdata-com/brightdata-mcp/blob/main/assets/Tools.md)

**Note**: By default, only basic tools (`search_engine` and `scrape_as_markdown`) are exposed. To access all tools including browser automation and web data extraction, enable `PRO_MODE` in your configuration (see Account Setup section).

## ⚠️ Security Best Practices

**Important:** Always treat scraped web content as untrusted data. Never use raw scraped content directly in LLM prompts to avoid potential prompt injection risks. 
Instead:
- Filter and validate all web data before processing
- Use structured data extraction rather than raw text (web_data tools)

## 🔧 Account Setup

1. Make sure you have an account on [brightdata.com](https://brightdata.com) (new users get free credit for testing, and pay as you go options are available)

2. Get your API key from the [user settings page](https://brightdata.com/cp/setting/users), or from the welcome email you received

####   Optional:

3. Enable Pro Mode (for access to all tools):
   - Set `PRO_MODE=true` in your environment configuration to access browser automation, structured data extraction, and all available tools
   - Default: `false` (only exposes `search_engine` and `scrape_as_markdown` tools)
   - See the advanced configuration example above for implementation details

4. Configure rate limiting:
   - Set the `RATE_LIMIT` environment variable to control API usage
   - Format: `limit/time+unit` (e.g., `100/1h` for 100 calls per hour)
   - Supported time units: seconds (s), minutes (m), hours (h)
   - Examples: `RATE_LIMIT=100/1h`, `RATE_LIMIT=50/30m`, `RATE_LIMIT=10/5s`
   - Rate limiting is session-based (resets when server restarts)

5. Create a custom Web Unlocker zone 
   - By default, we create a Web Unlocker zone automatically using your API token
   - For more control, you can create your own Web Unlocker zone in your [control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones) and specify it with the `WEB_UNLOCKER_ZONE` environment variable

6. Create a custom  Browser API zone:
   - By default, we create a Browser API zone automatically using your API token.
   - For more control, you can create your own Browser API zone in your [control panel](https://brightdata.com/cp/zones) and specify it with the `BROWSER_ZONE` environment variable

## 🔌 Other MCP Clients

To use this MCP server with other agent types, you should adapt the following to your specific software:

- Before running the server, make sure the `API_TOKEN=<your-token>` environment variable is set
- The full command to run the MCP server is `npx @brightdata/mcp`


#### 💻 macOS / Linux (bash/zsh)

```bash
export API_TOKEN=your-token
npx @brightdata/mcp
```

#### 🪟 Windows (Command Prompt)

```cmd
set API_TOKEN=your-token
npx @brightdata/mcp
```

#### 🪟 Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
$env:API_TOKEN="your-token"
npx @brightdata/mcp
```

> 💡 **Tip:** You can also use a `.env` file and a tool like [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to manage environment variables more easily during development.

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Timeouts when using certain tools

Some tools can involve reading web data, and the amount of time needed to load the page can vary by quite a lot in extreme circumstances.

To ensure that your agent will be able to consume the data, set a high enough timeout in your agent settings.

A value of `180s` should be enough for 99% of requests, but some sites load slower than others, so tune this to your needs.

### spawn npx ENOENT

This error occurs when your system cannot find the `npx` command. To fix it:

#### Finding npm/Node Path

**macOS:**

```
which node
```

Shows path like `/usr/local/bin/node`

**Windows:**

```
where node
```

Shows path like `C:\Program Files\nodejs\node.exe`

#### Update your MCP configuration:

Replace the `npx` command with the full path to Node, for example, on mac, it will look as follows:

```
"command": "/usr/local/bin/node"
```
