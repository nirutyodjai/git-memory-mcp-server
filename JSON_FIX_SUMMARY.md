# MCP Configuration JSON Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The provided MCP configuration JSON had several syntax errors that made it invalid:

1. **Missing closing braces and commas** - The JSON structure was incomplete
2. **Docker commands mixed in** - Lines like `FROM python:3.12-slim` and `RUN pip install codegen` were incorrectly included
3. **Improper string escaping** - Backslashes in file paths needed proper escaping
4. **Malformed structure** - Missing proper object closures

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Structural Fixes
- Added missing closing braces `}` and commas `,`
- Removed Docker commands that don't belong in JSON configuration
- Properly closed all JSON objects and arrays

### ✅ Path Corrections
- Fixed Windows file path escaping (single `\` to double `\\`)
- Corrected URL formatting in GitLab and Codegen configurations

### ✅ Configuration Completions
- Added missing server configurations that were cut off
- Included complete `globalSettings` and `traeIntegration` sections
- Ensured all server entries have proper structure

## Result
- **Original**: Invalid JSON with syntax errors
- **Fixed**: Valid JSON configuration saved as `mcp-config-fixed.json`
- **Validation**: ✅ Passed JSON syntax validation

## Key Servers Included
- Figma Developer MCP
- 3D-SCO suite (Playwright, Multifetch, Blender, Thinking, Memory)
- Standard MCP servers (Fetch, Time, Puppeteer, etc.)
- Third-party integrations (Slack, GitLab, Google Maps, etc.)
- Development tools (Codegen, Excel, MySQL, etc.)

## Usage
The corrected configuration can now be used as a valid MCP server configuration file for Trae AI or other MCP-compatible systems.
