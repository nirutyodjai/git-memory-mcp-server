# Contributing to Git Memory MCP Server

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Git Memory MCP Server as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/git-memory-mcp-server.git
   cd git-memory-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Run in development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

## Code Style

We use ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality and consistency:

- **Linting**: `npm run lint`
- **Formatting**: `npm run format`
- **Type checking**: `npm run type-check`

### Code Style Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow existing naming conventions
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Write tests for new functionality
