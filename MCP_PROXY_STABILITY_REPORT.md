# MCP Proxy Servers Stability and Connectivity Report

## Executive Summary

This report presents the results of stability and connectivity testing for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Proxy Server infrastructure. The testing was conducted on three concurrent proxy servers managing a total of 170 MCP servers, significantly exceeding the previous single-server limit of 124 servers.

## System Architecture

### Proxy Server Configuration

| Proxy Server | Port | Server Count | Status | Specialized Capabilities |
|--------------|------|--------------|--------|--------------------------|
| Proxy 1 | 3001 | 60 servers | ✅ Healthy | Memory, Thinking, Chart, API Integration |
| Proxy 2 | 3002 | 55 servers | ✅ Healthy | ADR Analysis, Figma Integration, Document Processing |
| Proxy 3 | 3003 | 55 servers | ✅ Healthy | Advanced Memory, Data Analytics, ML Processing, Workflow Automation |

**Total Capacity**: 170 MCP servers (38% increase from previous 124-server limit)

## Testing Methodology

### 1. Health Check Testing
- **Objective**: Verify operational status of all proxy servers
- **Method**: HTTP GET requests to `/health` endpoints
- **Frequency**: Real-time monitoring

### 2. API Endpoint Validation
- **Objective**: Test availability of core API endpoints
- **Endpoints Tested**: `/`, `/health`, `/servers`, `/servers/count`, `/status`, `/tools`, `/call`
- **Method**: HTTP requests with 3-5 second timeouts

### 3. Load Distribution Analysis
- **Objective**: Verify proper load balancing across proxy servers
- **Method**: Server count verification and resource monitoring

## Test Results

### ✅ Successful Tests

#### Health Status Verification
```
Proxy 1 (Port 3001): ✅ Healthy - 60 servers
Proxy 2 (Port 3002): ✅ Healthy - 55 servers  
Proxy 3 (Port 3003): ✅ Healthy - 55 servers
Total: 170 servers operational
```

#### Available API Endpoints
- `/health` - Server health status ✅
- `/servers` - MCP server listing ✅
- `/servers/count` - Server count information ✅

### ❌ Identified Issues

#### Unavailable Endpoints
- `/` - Root endpoint (404 Not Found)
- `/status` - Status endpoint (404 Not Found)
- `/tools` - Tools listing (404 Not Found)
- `/call` - Tool execution endpoint (404 Not Found)

#### MCP Tool Execution
- Direct tool execution via `/call` endpoint failed
- Error: "The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found"
- Impact: Limited to server management functions only

## Performance Metrics

### Stability Indicators
- **Uptime**: 100% during testing period
- **Response Time**: < 3 seconds for all successful endpoints
- **Connection Success Rate**: 100% for available endpoints
- **Load Distribution**: Balanced across all three proxies

### Capacity Analysis
- **Previous Limit**: 124 servers (single proxy)
- **Current Capacity**: 170 servers (three proxies)
- **Improvement**: +46 servers (+38% increase)
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling successfully implemented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Implement Missing Endpoints**
   - Add `/call` endpoint for MCP tool execution
   - Implement `/tools` endpoint for tool discovery
   - Add proper routing for root (`/`) and `/status` endpoints

2. **API Enhancement**
   - Enable direct MCP tool invocation through proxy servers
   - Implement proper error handling and response formatting
   - Add authentication and rate limiting mechanisms

### Future Improvements
1. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Implement comprehensive health monitoring
   - Add automated failover mechanisms
   - Create performance dashboards

2. **Scalability Enhancements**
   - Test with additional proxy servers (4+)
   - Implement dynamic load balancing
   - Add auto-scaling capabilities based on demand

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Add request validation and sanitization
   - Enable HTTPS/TLS encryption

## Conclusion

The MCP Proxy Server infrastructure demonstrates excellent stability and connectivity for basic server management operations. The three-proxy architecture successfully handles 170 MCP servers with 100% uptime and reliable performance.

**Key Achievements:**
- ✅ 38% increase in server capacity (124 → 170 servers)
- ✅ Successful horizontal scaling implementation
- ✅ Stable multi-proxy operation
- ✅ Effective load distribution

**Critical Gap:**
- ❌ MCP tool execution functionality not operational
- ❌ Several API endpoints missing or non-functional

The system is production-ready for server management tasks but requires additional development for full MCP tool execution capabilities.
