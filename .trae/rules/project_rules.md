# SOLO API Project Rules

## API Design Guidelines

1. Single Responsibility
   - Each endpoint should handle one specific task
   - Keep endpoint logic focused and cohesive

2. RESTful Practices
   - Use standard HTTP methods appropriately (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
   - Follow consistent URL naming conventions
   - Return proper status codes

3. Security
   - Implement authentication for all endpoints
   - Validate all input data
   - Sanitize responses to prevent data leaks

4. Documentation
   - Document all endpoints with clear descriptions
   - Include request/response examples
   - Specify required parameters and types

5. Error Handling
   - Return standardized error responses
   - Include meaningful error messages
   - Log errors appropriately

## Development Standards

1. Code Style
   - Follow consistent naming conventions
   - Keep functions small and focused
   - Comment complex logic

2. Testing
   - Write unit tests for all endpoints
   - Include integration tests
   - Maintain high test coverage

3. Version Control
   - Use clear commit messages
   - Create feature branches
   - Review code before merging

4. Performance
   - Optimize database queries
   - Implement caching where appropriate
   - Monitor API response times

## Maintenance

1. Monitoring
   - Track API usage and errors
   - Set up alerts for critical issues
   - Monitor system resources

2. Updates
   - Document API changes
   - Maintain backwards compatibility
   - Plan deprecation cycles

3. Support
   - Provide clear contact information
   - Document troubleshooting steps
   - Maintain API status page
